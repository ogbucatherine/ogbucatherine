Git is a distributed version control tool that allows you to track various changes made on a project. It is easy, fast, flexible, safe, and free open-source¹. 

To use Git in Bash, you can install Git Bash³. Once installed, you can initialise Git through the terminal by running the command `git init`. This downloads hidden files in the project folder. You can then choose files to share by running the command `git add yourfilename` or `git add .` which adds all the files. You can save the selected files with a message and then you are ready to share them by running the command `git commit -m ''Added my files''`³.
